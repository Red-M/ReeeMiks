# In this fork

This fork of deej adds remappable button support. Buttons must be defined in config with int values. The key values can be found here: https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event/blob/master/keybd_windows.go (make sure to convert hex values to int)

Be sure to visit the [original repository](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

# How to

 - Upload the Arduino code to your board (be sure to change the pin definitions).
 - Download the `deej-release.exe` file and `config.yaml` from the [release section](https://github.com/Miodec/deej/releases/tag/compile) (`deej-dev` will show a debug console window when launched)
 - If you run into any issues, feel free to ask in the [Deej Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu)
