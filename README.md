# ReeeMiks

ReeeMiks is a fork of deej, an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to **seamlessly control the volumes of different apps** (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.

I'll put more into this later, for now reference deej.
