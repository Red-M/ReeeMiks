Unlike the previous maintainer, I don't care about what you're doing, I only ask that:

1. You make your PRs readable and are clear about what you're wanting to add and why.
2. New features and bugfixes are king, I'll get to your PRs/patches as I can
3. This is software, it has bug, expect bugs
4. Cross platform is a nicety, not everything will work for your platform
5. Linux will get priority as I don't have any windows machines anymore, this does not mean that OSX and windows are "deprecated" I simply do not have the power to personally test on those platforms. (Hint: that means I will be looking for people who I can trust to test and provide feedback on those platforms)
